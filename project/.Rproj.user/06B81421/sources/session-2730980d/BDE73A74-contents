Create a new Rstudio project

1.  In the terminal, type `quarto create project`
2.  Select blog by using the down arrows and enter
3.  Set directory as `.` (to create the blog in the 'project' folder rather than a subfolder inside that)
4.  choose a title
5.  once your documents have been created, reload posit cloud to get the 'build' button (can do this by changing the version of R, and then changing back to 4.4.3)
6.  edit the \_quarto.yml, index.qmd, about.qmd and posts

## Editing the \_quarto.yml

Example \_quarto.yml:

``` r
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  title: "R guide"
  navbar:
    right:
      - about.qmd
      - text: "Posts"
        menu: 
          - text: "How to build a blog"
            href: posts/blog.qmd
    left: 
      - icon: star
        text: "QQM"
        href: https://ks745.quarto.pub/qqm/
      - icon: moon
        text: "Discovering Statistics"
        href: https://ks745.quarto.pub/discovering-statistics/

format:
  html:
    theme: 
      light: custom.scss
      dark: cyborg
    highlight-style: dracula
```

# Posts

There are lots of ways to customise posts, including with an author, time, image, category and contents

Add to the top of a post (you may need to put `---` in the source at the beginning and end of this code to put it in the box)

Example:

``` r
---
title: "How to make a blog"
author: "Kaz Sweetnam"
date: "2025-03-11"
categories: [blog]
image: "image.jpg"
toc: true
toc-depth: 4
toc-title: Contents
toc-location: right
self-contained: true
editor: visual
format: 
  html: 
    highlight-style: dracula

```
