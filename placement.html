	<div class="textbox">
		<p>In my third year of my Psychology undergraduate degree at Sussex 
		University, I completed a sandwich placement year at Brighton and Hove 
		Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).</p>
		<h3>Structure of my placement</h3>
		<p>Within CAMHS, there are four pathways:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Depression and Anxiety Pathway, which assesses and treats young people with depression, anxiety, or OCD</li>
			<li>Trauma Pathway, which assesses and treats young people with PTSD symptoms</li>
			<li>Emotional Intensity Pathway, which provides DBT (Dialectical Behavioural Therapy)</li>
			<li>Neurodevelopmental Pathway, which assesses young people for Austism Spectrum Condition (ASC) and ADHD</li>
		</ol>
		<p>I was involved in all of these pathways, as well as a Sussex-wide Participation team, which 
		encourages Experts by Experience to be involved in decisions regarding how CAMHS is run.</p>

	<h3>Literature reviews</h3>
    <p>I independently researched and wrote two literature reviews about interventions that CAMHS had previously offered, as well as collaborating with another student to produce a further two literature reviews.
	These literature reviews were then used to inform the planning of the transformation of CAMHS to be using evidence-based practices</p>

	<h3>OCD parent/carer workshop</h3>
	<p>I helped faciliate a workshop for parents and carers of young people waiting for CBT for OCD. After the workshop, we offered 1:1 consultations, during which I took mintutes and completed the admin for. Following the consultations and workshop I collabored with the therapists to write up the pilot, including independently analysing the feedback we recieved and creating an informative poster.</p>

	<h3>Parent information packs</h3>
    <p>In collaboration with clinicians, I helped create information packs to give to parents with resources about PTSD and OCD. My role was to assist with research and to create the packs in a visually appealing and easy-to-read way, whilst following NHS guidance regarding colours and fonts.</p>

	<h3>Waiting room infographics</h3>
    <p>I collaborated with the other student on placement to create monthly informative displays for the waiting area. For example, I created infographics about Autism Awareness Month, LGBTQ+ History Month, and mental health over the festive season.</p>

	<h3>Resource boxes</h3>
    <p>Prior to this project, individual clincians brought in their own resources, such as fidget tools and prompt sheets, to use in therapy sessions with the young people. The other student and I identified that having a resources box for each clinic room, and an assortment of games for clinicians to use in sessions, would be incredibly helpful for clinicians. We created and sent out a survey to every clincian in Brighton CAMHS, and then created a list of items to be purchased based on the survey results. Additionally, we designed our own prompt sheets, such as breathing techniques, to create a cohesive collection of resources.</p>

	<p>Here is an example of OCD flashcards included in our research boxes:</p>

	<h3>Experience of service feedback</h3>
    <p>I took a lead role on the Neurodevelopmental Pathway - Experience of Service Questionnaire (ND ESQ) project. This involved:</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
		<li>Brainstorming ways of making it easier for clinicians to remember to give out the ND ESQ form. The solution we came up with was for me to monitor when clinicians had appointments, and give them the forms before each appointment.</li>
		<li>Collect and analyse the results, including transforming the data into themes and understandable graphs.</li>
		<li>Create a presentation of these results and present to the Neurodevelopmental Pathway team.</li>
		<li>A common theme of the feedback was that parents felt that signposting to support was lacking while their child was waiting for an assessment.</li> 
		<li>As a result, I created a padlet of resources specific to the Neurodevelopmental Pathway, assisted with resources collected by another team. This padlet will be given to parents and young people, to improve awareness of support available while they are waiting for an ASC or ADHD assessment.</li>
	</ul>
  </div>

	<h3>Padlets</h3>
    <p>While creating the monthly infographics for the waiting room, the other student and I reflected that there was no space within CAMHS for support resources to be pooled for convenience. In particular, there was confusion in CAMHS around what resources we could recommend to young trans people following the Cass report. We decided to create a padlet of approved resources, both for clinicians to pull resources from, and to give to families using CAMHS.</p>
	<p>We created two padlets: one for generic support resources, and one specifically for the Neurodevelopmental Pathway</p>

	<h3>Staff appreciations</h3>
    <p>A tradition of the placement students at Brighton CAMHS is to create a monthly board of appreciative messages staff members send in about each other. The other placement student and I happily continued this tradition, fostering a welcoming and positive working environment for all the staff working there.</p>
	<p>Reading what staff members were thakful for, as well as witnessing their positive reactions upon receiving the kind messages, was lovely. In particular, one doctor mentioned that the tradition made entering her new role much easier, as it made the atmosphere of the office feel accepting and kind.</p>
